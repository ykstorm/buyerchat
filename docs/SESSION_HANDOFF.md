## Last updated

2026-04-26 23:00 IST — META-2 sprint completion

## What just shipped (most recent first)

- `<META-2 SHA>` — productivity infra: `npm run verify`, session handoff doc, report verdict format, confidence rules, two-phase prompt template, demo script
- `853a145` — INFRA-1: agent perm allowlist, pre-commit schema guard, GitHub Actions CI
- `129d220` — Pricing API lockdown (POST/PUT reject pricing fields, redirect to canonical)
- `6be0fda` — NextAuth maxAge 12h + Sentry PII scrub + capture state-probe lockdown
- `a0c6efa` — Stage A soft capture wired into chat
- `bf5fba2` — P2-WAVE2 audit bundle (master fix list + 4 sub-audits)

## What's in flight

Nothing in flight as of this writing. Last sprint (META-2) committed
clean. Working tree is clean except for untracked `.claude/` agent
config files (`.agent/`, `mcp-servers.json`, `rules/`, `skills/`,
`scheduled_tasks.lock`, `settings.local.json`) that intentionally
stay local.

## What's queued (priority order)

1. **P2-WAVE2-A1** — Stage B Hard Capture (single agent, foreground, 1-2 hr). Spec in operator-provided prompt; Option 1 (phone-only, no verify) decision is locked. `VERIFY_METHOD=none` default.
2. **P2-WAVE2-A2** — In-chat visit booking 4-step flow (sequential after A1, ~1 day).
3. **P2-WAVE2-A3** — Stage-aware follow-up buttons (sequential after A2, 4 hr).
4. **P2-WAVE2-B** — parallel: lead scoring + junk mark, A1b/A1c pricing UI strip, navbar/floating-button cleanup.
5. **P2-WAVE2-C** — parallel: `withSentry` route wrapper, Playwright e2e.
6. **INFRA-2** — Dockerize (compose for local dev, multi-stage prod, GHCR push, dependabot).
7. **P2-DEMO** — `/showcase` cinematic marketing surface (Linear/Vercel/Apple-style motion). LAST. Record demo video against this route, not the real `/chat`.

## Open decisions (operator pending)

- **None blocking.** META-2 was a pure-infra sprint with no decisions.

## Known issues / workarounds

- `/chat` First Load JS is 300 kB (target 280 kB). Workaround: noted in `docs/MASTER_FIX_LIST.md` Block C5 — finish LazyMotion + lazy ReactMarkdown will close the gap. Not blocking demo.
- Schema-format-only commits hit the pre-commit migration check. Workaround: `git commit --no-verify` once with documented reason; future schema changes go through the hook normally. The bootstrap commit `853a145` is the documented precedent.
- `gh` CLI not installed locally — operator verifies CI runs at <https://github.com/ykstorm/buyerchat/actions> manually.

## Verification state (last `npm run verify` baseline)

- Tests: **148/148** passing
- Build: **clean**, /chat 300 kB, / 268 kB shared
- Lint: clean on touched files (pre-existing warnings on untouched files OK per discipline §9)
- Schema: `prisma validate` passes
- Sentry: 5 issues open — JS-NEXTJS-K/E/J pending operator-resolution (closed by recent commits per `docs/diagnostics/sentry-resolution-log-2026-04-26.md`); JS-NEXTJS-B (NO_MARKDOWN) and JS-NEXTJS-9 (RERA timeout) intentionally audit-only

## Mama's last test session

- Pricing entry workflow not yet retested by Mama post-lockdown commit `129d220`.
- 3 unverified `analystNote` rows still pending review per `docs/diagnostics/insider-note-mama-review.md` (Riviera Bliss, Shaligram Pride, Vishwanath Sarathya West).

## Latest production deployment

- Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`. Last push was `853a145` followed by META-2.
- Operator reported "can't find any new deployments." Likely causes:
  1. Vercel project not linked to GitHub repo `ykstorm/buyerchat` (most likely)
  2. Auto-deploy disabled in Vercel project settings
  3. Build failing on Vercel side (different from CI; check Vercel dashboard logs)
- **Action required next session:** verify Vercel↔GitHub integration. If broken, re-link via `vercel link` + push to trigger.
